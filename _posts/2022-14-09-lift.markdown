summary: "To leverage large pretrained language models for learning non-language tasks, e.g., tabular data classification, we propose the use of natural language interface to convert non-language data into the format of textual data used in language models. Our method, LIFT, is shown to work pretty well on a suite of classification and regression tasks, include image classification."
