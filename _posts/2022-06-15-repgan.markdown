summary: "We aim to repurpose pretrained unconditional generative models to generate conditional samples. To do so, our method InRep+ utilizes the input reprogramming framework where we only modify the latent (noise) distribution and leave the pretrained generator unchanged. Our method shows significant computing savings compared to fine-tuning or full CGANs training, with comparable or even better generation performance when the amount of labeled data is small."
