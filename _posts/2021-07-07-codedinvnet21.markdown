summary: "We study how to improve the resilience of ML service system. Our method is based on the coded computation method where we encode inputs in such a way that we can simply and effectively reconstruct the failed outputs. To apply the idea for ML models, we propose Coded-InvNet framework with utilizing the invertibility of neural network and the image-to-image translation model. We show that our framework improves the resilience of MLSS, especially with the setting of large numbers of queries."
